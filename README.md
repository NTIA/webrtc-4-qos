# webrtc-4-qos
WebRTC code used for Public Safety Communications Research

## Getting Started
I will describe the setup of my development environment on OSX:

1. Download the .zip or clone this repository onto your local machine.
2. Set up the Apache server on your Mac, here is what I used: [Apache server setup for OSX](http://getgrav.org/blog/mac-os-x-apache-setup-multiple-php-versions)
3. Go to where you downloaded or cloned the code. `cd` into the `webrtc-4-qos` directory
